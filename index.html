                    <p>This blog shares insights and reflections on the award-winning short film HELLO (1st Place in the
                        Nikon Cinema Z Film Fest 2019) directed by Richard Galapate. Through the reactions of different
                        viewers, it highlights how a simple word like “hello” can break loneliness, build connection,
                        and spread kindness. It reminds us that small acts of compassion can make a big difference in
                        someone’s life and that understanding and acceptance often begin with one small gesture.

                <p>The short film HELLO, directed by Richard Galapate, and winner of 1st Place in the Nikon Cinema Z
                    Film Fest 2019, shares a heartfelt message about kindness, acceptance, and connection. It imagines a
                    world where a simple “hello” could be the antidote to loneliness and the bridge to unity among
                    different kinds of people. In a time when everyone is connected online but still feels emotionally
                    distant, the film reminds us that even a small gesture of kindness can have a big impact.<br><br>

                    The story follows Charles, a loner who likes being alone but hates the feeling of loneliness. He
                    spends most of his time in front of his computer and avoids social interaction because he’s afraid
                    to reach out. Everything changes when a woman named Angelica says a simple “hello.” That single word
                    becomes the start of change, proving that kindness and connection can start with even the smallest
                    act.<br>
                    <br>
                    As Relox wrote, the film captures the idea that reaching out, no matter how small the effort, can
                    lead to understanding, acceptance, and friendship. Meanwhile, Cisneros reflected that the story
                    teaches how fear can stop us from growing and connecting. He realized that a simple “hello” or small
                    act of kindness can open doors to new relationships and that embracing diversity allows deeper
                    connections to grow.<br><br>

                    Borbe’s reflection focused on how the film reminds us that kindness doesn’t need to be big or
                    expensive—it can start with something as easy as a smile or greeting. She was touched by how the
                    movie showed people from different backgrounds and situations, teaching that no matter how different
                    we are, everyone deserves kindness and respect.

                    <br>
                    <br>In the end, all three viewers agreed that HELLO is more than just a short film—it’s a gentle
                    reminder to be kind, open, and understanding. It teaches that compassion and connection begin with
                    simple efforts and that even one word can make someone feel seen and valued. The film shows us that
                    sometimes, the courage to say “hello” can truly make a difference.
